I made the Auto_LS_WR_fit program to automatically run and generate all light curves and MCMC fit all 
of the available Wolf-Rayet stars and put them in their separate folders. Since running the program 
would generate a massive amount of data, I will only include the notebook here and the data and results 
would be appended later (by other means).

(Update) Current results are now available via the included compressed files in this folder - 'Results.rar'
